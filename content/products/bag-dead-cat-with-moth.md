Sunflowers sleep at night and are waiting for daylight .

The moth is on its way already for a brighter new day .

Little black-eyed cat wants to be carried around at your bag and filled with all the things that are shining especially for you .

This is way more a unique little painting on cotton you can carry with you and put things into, than a printed tote bag you are used too .

The bag is homemade and sewed by myself .

The fabric-paint I used is water resistant but I only recommend cold handwashing for safety . ??
