Forest tribe number five:

Five mushrooms and a cat enjoying the trance in its own wonderland .

This is way more a unique little painting on cotton you can carry with you and put things into, than a printed tote bag you are used too .

The fabric-paint I used is water resistant but I only recommend cold handwashing .

There is also a little UV-color effect on it for the nights .
