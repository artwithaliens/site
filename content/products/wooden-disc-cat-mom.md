She is a cat mom .

Hearing in every littl cat-sound of meow a very different meaning, seeing all the stories told behind each cat-motion clearly and feeling this deep and true connection to this forever-baby-cat sleeping in her bed .
?Ô∏è ??

Here is a natural piece of wood, I found and filled the gap with crushed amethysts in purple and lavender . Hope there is an extra of protection and mystic vibes coming to your happy place so .
