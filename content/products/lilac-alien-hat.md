here is a lilac and black self-knitted alien-head .
it is a unique handmade piece, ready to wear .

it is made of hight-quality wool .
so please cold hand-washing only .
u should not buy it if u are allergic to cat, because they truly love sitting by my side while i am knitting

otherwise if u are a dread-head or have freaky hair that wants to be seen u should totally buy it .

Ã¸ 26 cm
