It is one big sticker !.

(When you are ordering an 'Universe Inside' zipper or 'Universe Inside' shirt it comes with one of these stickers automatically)

There is a universe of colors and magic inside yourself that wants to be discovered&nbsp; .

Ways to discover it and being a happy little deep-sea diver are unique for each of us, but I assume that it is mostly a journey through darkness that leads us to the most lightful places in our souls .
