This is a unique original painting from me .

finished august 2019

Ready for finding its new safeplace in case someones' bats wanna hang with the painted ones .

&nbsp;

wild roses and many white flowers, a prince and a princess-cat waiting for their wings to grow, four little bats communicating on their very own frequency, falling asleep when seeing in the eyes of the sun..

a magical geometric scenery captured with acrylic-paint on a heavy black wooden-plate

?
