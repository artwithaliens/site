I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need our tongues touching to fly high, because my wings are sometimes a lie .
Be my samurai, I need your protection to feel the better action from my safe place in your heart .
What we are is art .
Life is like a videogame, with panda-bears and many fears,
I'm in the dark, but we have coffee here and tree little pigs that want you near .

My original Die Antwoord portrait is available now ..

Added as many animal-friends and extraterrestrial extra long tongues .
Maybe as a present for yourself or for your mum ..

We are all aliens and we are all art .
?
