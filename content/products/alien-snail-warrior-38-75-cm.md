Alien-snail-warrior found two little mouse-friends on her barefoot way through the magical woodland with a little house on her head for never getting wet .

Here is an original painting showing a scenery full of golden-light, the pureness of the inner child that's protected endlessly and the connection to nature that makes us free .
