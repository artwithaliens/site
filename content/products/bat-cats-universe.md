'Bat-cats universe' is a huge wall-hanging . 1.45m x 2.15m . 100% cotton, dyed with mixed acrylic-colors and painted with special fabric-paint .

There are special florescent-light effects on the eyes and the moons that your alien-eyes can see under uv-light .

Fixed by ironing several times .

So, basically waterproof, but recommended for indoor-use .

Please iron once from the backside when it reaches ur alien-safeplace, cause its fold for shipping .
