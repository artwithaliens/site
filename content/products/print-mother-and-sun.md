here is hight quality print on nearly the size of the original commission-work, that is at a tattoo-studio in Moscow now .

the colors are very bright and complementary, and the eyes of the mother are hypnotizing on a psychedelic kind of way .
the cat-son, who get licked by the mother got everything in its little paw .

as well as everything lies in your hand
