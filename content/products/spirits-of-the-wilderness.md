An unique original-drawing of mine comes in a vintage frame fitting its golden shine and steampunk style of nine well .

Hope you've got an open eye for this piece . It means a lot to me personally, cause I feel that we are part of a tribe of wilderness spirits that do not let this planet's wonder to fall apart .
