This is a A4-sized print of my painting 'with a heart full of moonlight'.
The big full-shining-moon and the motif of an alien with her spirit animal side by side are here to bring some color and harmony into ur safeplace and some dreams to ur mind .
I would love to sign it as u wish . ‚ù§

'the fox is seing ur soul
while da bumblebees are busy searching for some sweetness
and oh, how u shine, with ur heart full of moonlight'
