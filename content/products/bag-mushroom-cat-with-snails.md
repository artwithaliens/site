A black eyed baby-cat so excited for the slowness of the snails, reminding u of the wonderfulness of moving on consciously .

This is way more a unique little painting on cotton you can carry with you and put things into, than a printed tote bag you are used too .

The bag is homemade and sewed by myself .

The fabric-paint I used is water resistant but I only recommend cold handwashing for safety . ??
