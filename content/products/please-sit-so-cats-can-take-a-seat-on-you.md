a drawing with pens and ink and watercolors on thick aquarelle-paper in a suiting wooden frame .

please sit down so the cats can take a seat on you comfortably is written on this alien-toilet-style art .

your cats and all the other animal-friends with need for cuddling will love you for hanging it as an instruction
.. yeah, they always love u no matter what
