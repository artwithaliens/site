a littl black eyed kitty cat growing mushrooms on its head .
There are roots reching from the bones to the deep and dark black, but first it is time for living the best-life-possible yet .

This is way more a unique little painting on cotton you can carry with you and put things into, than a printed tote bag you are used too .

The bag is homemade and sewed by myself .

The fabric-paint I used is water resistant but I only recommend cold handwashing for safety . ??
