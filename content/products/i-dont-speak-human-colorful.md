‘I Don't Speak Human’ is a colorful wall-hanging .

A deep connection to the forest and to the animal-friends is shown in this textile painting in my trippy alien-art way .

1.05m x 1.30m . 100% cotton, upcycled, dyed with mixed acrylic-colors and painted with special fabric-paint .

Fixed by ironing several times .

So, basically waterproof, but recommended for indoor-use .

Please iron once from the backside when it reaches ur alien-safeplace, cause its fold for shipping .
