This is an unique original painting . Painted on a black wooden-plate .

Colorful flowers, a littl wild-animal and an alien-girl reaching out for the freedom of wilderness .

There is UV-active color added for the special psychedelic-3D feeling .

. the flowers u pick care able to regrow, but the moments u haven' lived wild and to its fullest are gone forever .
