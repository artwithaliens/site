Here is a little drawing in a painted wooden-frame inspired by the little prince .

The roots of the rose are the ground on which the fox is sitting at and the rain, the fox is feeling on its skin is what the rose needs for growing .

U are never alone on dis planet the message is, you are connected deeply to the ones u are familiar with . forever .

. humans have forgotten this truth, the fox said . but u must not forget it . u become responsible forever for what you have get familiar with . u are responsible for your rose .
