This is a unique original painting on a wooden-plate .

Ready for finding its new forever home after being exhibited happily for many times .

Which place will they fly to ?.

intuitive structures and geometry, a half moon, plants and shrooms, black sky, bright stars, a black-eyed moth-cat and its alien friend ready for a intergalactic flight .??
